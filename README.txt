Hi, my name is Srikant Tangirala. This is my Book Cricket game developed in Python.
In case you are unfamiliar with how Book Cricket works, check out the rules.txt file (either now or while you play the game).
In all other respects, the game is pretty much like any other cricket game you'd find on the Play Store - you can choose your team, its squad, the batting order, bowler for each over, etc. and play.
It's kinda fun to see how familiar cricketing names perform with the ball and bat in a randomized world :D

Further development will be done as I think of more features to add.
