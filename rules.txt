Book cricket is a popular game among schoolchildren, often played in the back benches of boring classes.

The rules are as simple as they get:

A book with numbered pages (preferably a thick one) is flipped and a page is opened at random.

The last digit of the page number determines the runs scored or wickets lost as follows:

(1) if 0 < digit <= 6, it denotes the number of runs scored.

(2) if digit > 6, subtracting 6 from it denotes the runs scored.

(3) if digit = 0, a wicket is lost.

This program stimulates this simple but elegant game.
